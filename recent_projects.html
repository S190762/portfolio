                                <div class="supporting_text">
                                    <p>For my 2019 Dissertation Project, I developed a 2D Game Engine in the Rust programming language. I had no prior experience of the Rust language, so this is a prime example of my ability to understand the key concepts of programming and learn a new language. The Game Engine utilises the modern development paradigm of Entity Component Systems. This is an emerging area of game development that defines the relationship between entities, their components and systems which modify or control entities.

                                        Super Battle is a 2D, multiplayer co-operative game created using the Unity Game Engine for my 2019 Game project. The core concept of the game is that there are multiple items on the level which when picked up by a player modify one of their stats. The player who gains the most points by using the items to their advantage wins the round.

                                    <h2>"No Reflections" Unreal Engine 3D Puzzle Game</h2>
                                    <div class="supporting_text">
                                            My main group project for 2019 was the creation of a 3D Puzzle game in the Unreal Engine. The premise of the game is you are lost in a dark maze with only a light beam and various mirrors which you can use to guide yourself round the level. The game featured a light beam mechanic which could be bounced off mirrors using reflections. One of the main issues experienced was the lack of dynamic lighting within the Unreal Engine. This was solved using undocumented features which allowed the use of global illumination and dynamic lighting using diffuse shaders. This allowed a realistic light beam to be produced which lit up the environment. I was responsible for the programming on this project.

                                            In 2018 I was tasked with researching an emerging area of technology in the role of games development. I researched the use of modern graphics pipelines such as Vulkan and DirectX12. As part of this assignment I created a graphical benchmark using C++ and the Vulkan framework. I performed a performance comparison between DirectX12, Vulkan and OpenGL.
